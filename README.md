# BubbleMania
An example video of this application built and running on device can be found on my [YouTube Channel.](https://youtu.be/Ge-0DV4QB14 "YouTube")
Unity/Vuforia application where the user interacts with a 3D model chest augmented from a live photo of a treasure chest. The user will be able to open and close the chest at will as well as spwan endless bubbles as for engagement, distraction and tons of fun!
